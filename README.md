### Question Decomposition
**Core idea:** *complex questions can be challenging to handle, while answering simple questions is a breeze.*

LLMs are inherently endowed with powerful semantic understanding capabilities, offering us a preferred tool for parsing complex questions into simpler sub-questions. 
For KBQA, one would expect that each decomposed sub-question can be easily resolved with a single-hop inference over KG, yet this often requires some alignment between the LLM and the KG.
Therefore, we resort to [instruction fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) to adapt the LLM to the structured knowledge in KG for better decomposition result.

Specifically, we opt for fine-tuning **Llama2-7B** using [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) so that it is computationally affordable even with a single graphics card (like *A6000* or *RTX8000*).
To implement the fine-tuning, an easy-to-use project [LitGPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt) is recommened. What we need to do is to prepare the corpus for instruction fine-tuning, below is an example to illustrate the required data format.
```JSON
{
    "instruction": "Parse the user input question to several subquestions: [{'question': subquestion, 'id': subquestion_id, 'dep': dependency_subquestion_id, 'seed_entity': seed_entity or <GENERATED>-dep_id}]...",
    "input": "the actor of Kung Fu Panda also starred in which movies?",
    "output": "[{'question': 'who acted in the movie [MASK]?', 'id': 0, 'dep': [-1], 'seed_entity': ['Kung Fu Panda']}, {'question': 'what films did [MASK] act in?', 'id': 1, 'dep': [0], 'seed_entity': ['<GENERATED>-0']}]"
}
```
